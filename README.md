Simple OpenGL Image Library (SOIL)
==================================

## Introduction

SOIL is a tiny C library used primarily for uploading textures into OpenGL.
It is based on `stb_image` version 1.16, the public domain code from Sean
Barrett (found here). It has been extended to load TGA and DDS files, and
to perform common functions needed in loading OpenGL textures. SOIL can
also be used to save and load images in a variety of formats.


## Installation

With [clib](https://github.com/clibs/clib):

```sh
$ clib install littlstar/soil --save
```

From source:

```sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

## Usage

SOIL is meant to be used as a static library (as it's tiny and in the public domain).

Simply `#include <SOIL/SOIL.h>` in your C or C++ file, link in the static
library, and then use any of SOIL's functions. The file `<SOIL/SOIL.h`
contains simple doxygen style documentation. (If you use the static library,
no other header files are needed besides SOIL.h)


## Features

* No external dependencies
* Tiny
* Cross platform (Windows, \*nix, Mac OS X)
* Public Domain
* Can load an image file directly into a 2D OpenGL texture
* Can generate a new texture handle, or reuse one specified
* Can automatically rescale the image to the next largest power-of-two size
* Can automatically create MIPmaps
* Can scale (not simply clamp) the RGB values into the "safe range" for NTSC displays (16 to 235, as recommended [here][1])
* Can multiply alpha on load (for more correct blending / compositing)
* Can flip the image vertically
* Can compress and upload any image as DXT1 or DXT5 (if `EXT_texture_compression_s3tc` is available), using an internal (very fast!) compressor
* Can convert the RGB to YCoCg color space (useful with DXT5 compression: see [this link][2] from NVIDIA)
* Will automatically downsize a texture if it is larger than `GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE`
* Can directly upload DDS files (DXT1/3/5/uncompressed/cubemap, with or without MIPmaps). Note: directly uploading the compressed DDS image will disable the other options (no flipping, no pre-multiplying alpha, no rescaling, no creation of MIPmaps, no auto-downsizing)
* Can load rectangluar textures for GUI elements or splash screens (requires `GL_ARB/EXT/NV_texture_rectangle`)
* Can decompress images from RAM (e.g. via [PhysicsFS][3] or similar) into an OpenGL texture (same features as regular 2D textures, above)
* Can load cube maps directly into an OpenGL texture (same features as regular 2D textures, above)
* Can take six image files directly into an OpenGL cube map texture
* Can take a single image file where `width = 6 * height` (or vice versa), split it into an OpenGL cube map texture

### Readable Image Formats

* BMP - non-1bpp, non-RLE (from `stb_image` documentation)
* PNG - non-interlaced (from `stb_image` documentation)
* JPG - JPEG baseline (from `stb_image` documentation)
* TGA - greyscale or RGB or RGBA or indexed, uncompressed or RLE
* DDS - DXT1/2/3/4/5, uncompressed, cubemaps (can't read 3D DDS files yet)
* PSD - (from `stb_image` documentation)
* HDR - converted to LDR, unless loaded with *HDR* functions (RGBE or RGBdivA or RGBdivA2)

### Writeable Image Formats
* TGA - Greyscale or RGB or RGBA, uncompressed
* BMP - RGB, uncompressed
* DDS - RGB as DXT1, or RGBA as DXT5
